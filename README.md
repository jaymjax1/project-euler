# Strategies

## Factors

* To find all Factors of a number, iterate from 1 to half the number.When you find an iterator that divides the number evenly, push that into a data structure and also the number divided by the iterator. For example 4 is a factor of 8, so add 4, and (8/4) to a stack

* To find Prime Factors of a number, do the above function for a number to get all the factors. Once you have all the factors in an array. Run the function again for those numbers and see if the result is equal to 2 or more.# project-euler
